        Starting something new is difficult. 
        
        <p>
        When I begin something new it's hard to translate intention into results and the 
        idea of being judged based on results that don't match what I think I should be 
        capable of is terrifying. I don't know who said it first, but I've heard it said
        that an artist's taste develops faster than their skill, which can be painful for
        the aspiring novice. There's a temptation for me at least to focus on the pseudo-work of research and productivity-hacking rather than the risky business 
        of making things.                 
        </p>
        <p>
        To buck the trend for this project I have tried to produce something, anything, 
        as quickly and as roughly as possible. 
        </p>
        <p>
        This first attempt is nothing like what I eventually hope to build, but giving 
        myself the permission to start as a novice takes the edge off. The task tracking 
        for this project is a text file with todos and comments. The first draft is pure HTML with no CSS, javascript, or build tools of any kind. All I needed to know for this first step was a bit of HTML and how to use a text editor. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I may not know how to get to where I want to go but I can visualise what 'done' 
        looks like for the first step, and that has got me moving.
