        Starting something new is difficult. 
        
        <p>
        When I begin something new it's hard to translate intention into results 
        and the idea of being judged based on results that don't match what I 
        think I should be capable of is terrifying. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The fear of falling short of some imagined potential is compounded by the 
        anxiety of working for an uncertain amount of time on tasks I'm not sure 
        are leading where I want to go. So. Rather than actually beginning a new 
        project it's much safer to always be preparing, with as much granularity 
        as possible. Rather than risking failure, it's much more comfortable to 
        build elaborate productivity systems and convince myself that's real work. 
        </p>
        <p>
        To buck the trend for this project I have tried to produce something, 
        anything, as quickly as possible. This first attempt is nothing like what 
        I eventually hope to build, but giving myself the permission to start off 
        being bad at this takes the edge off.
        </p>

        The task tracking for this is a text file with todos and comments. All I 
        needed to know for this first step is a bit of HTML and how to use a 
        text editor.
        </p>
        <p>
        I may not know how to get to where I want to go but I can visualise what 
        'done' looks like for the first step, and that has got me moving.
